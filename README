LOADING FILES

If you want to target a specific framework, prefixing a css or js file with
"targetname_" will result in it only being included for the specific browser.

The following targets are recognized:

 - "jetpack_" (FireFox 4+)
 - "userscript_" (Firefox < 3.6 + Greasemonkey/Scriptish)
 - "chrome_" (Google Chrome)
 - "ie_" (Internet Explorer bookmarklet)
 - "safari_" (Safari)
 - "opera_" (Opera)

CSS must end in .css, JavaScript must end in .js.  All other files are ignored.

LOAD ORDER

If no load order is specified in the build.json (aka, it's left as []), the
following rules are used to determine the order they will be included (files
are identified by filenames, not content):

 1. Frameworks recognized by the Google Library API are loaded first (jQuery,
    MooTools, etc); ordered alphabetically.
 2. Plugins are loaded next; ordered alphabetically. Any files that match the
    following regex are considered plugins:
    [\w\d]*\.[\w][\w\d]{3,}\.(css|js)
 3. Lastly, any other files are loaded; ordered alphabetically.

If no order is specified, all CSS is loaded before JavaScript.  When loading
things alphabetically, the target prefix ("jetpack_", etc) is ignored.

It is recommended, however, that you specify the order of files in build.json if
you have more than one or two files, to prevent ambiguity.
