Steps to create a cross browser plugin:

  1. Create a new project folder.
     `new_project [project name]`
  2. Fill out the build.json file.
  3. Add .js and .css files to /includes/ (Note: if you need them to be loaded
     in a particular order, use `load_order` in build.json)
  4. Run the build command from the main directory.
     `python builder.py [project name]`

Right now it's fragile and a lot won't work- this is only v0.1.

Currently only supports Greasemonkey (Fx3.6) and Jetpack (Fx4). Chrome support coming soon.
