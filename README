Steps to create a cross browser plugin:

  1. Create a new project folder.
     `./new_project.sh`
  2. Fill out the build.json file.
  3. Add .js and .css files to /includes/ (Note: if you need them to be loaded
     in a particular order, use `load_order` in build.json)
  4. Run the build command from the main directory.
     `python builder.py [project name]`

Right now it's fragile and a lot won't work- this is only v0.1.

Currently only supports Greasemonkey (Fx3.6) and Jetpack (Fx4). Chrome support coming soon.

=============================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- Make sure you have Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed
- Make sure new_project.sh has the proper permissions (`chmod u+x new_project.sh`)
- Probably only works in OSX right now
- Make sure you init and update the submodules
- Jetpack .xpi's will only run in Fx4+; 3.6 requires Greasemonkey
- A majority of errors will be because of weird jetpack stuff; try running
  the jetpack stuff inside .builder/jetpack-sdk manually.  Eventually most
  of these problems will go away.
